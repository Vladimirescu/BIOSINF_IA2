## Project:

The requirements for completing your practical project, along with a list of available projects can be found [here](Project_IA2.pdf). 
We'll be available for discussions regarding the status of your project every Friday 17:00-18:00.

### General Rules for Lab Homeworks:
1. Each homework should be handed as a single Jupyter Notebook, containing your code, results and explanations
2. You **should not** create the homework notebook by continuing the lab notebook 
3. Any external files used throughout the notebook should be placed in a .zip archive, along with the main notebook
4. Do not include any datasets in the archive -- all homeworks are based on the datasets discussed at lab, therefore it is
recommended to use the already defined `torch.utils.data.Dataset` with the appropriate path of your dataset folder
5. **One should be able to run the homework notebook without any effort. Please make sure you include in your archive any 
local dependencies related to your notebook, as well as all neccessary ```!pip install ...``` if you use
additional packages not included in the ```lab_setup/requirements.txt```**

## Important dates:

| **Name** | **Date** |
|:-------:|:--------:|
|  Lab Homework(s) Submission Deadline  |  26.05  |
|  Project Submission Deadline  |  ~~29.05~~ 12.06  |
|  Project Presentations  |  ~~30.05 & 31.05~~ 15.06  |
